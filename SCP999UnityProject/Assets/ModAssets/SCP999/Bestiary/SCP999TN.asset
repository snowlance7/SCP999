    Sigurd''s danger level: -F%


    Scientific
    name: SCP-999


    When I saw this thing I thought it was a Hygrodere, but after
    closer inspection, it moves and behaves a lot differently. It seems to have an
    affinity to humans. Touching it made me feel relaxed, like all my fear just melted
    away. It followed us around and gave us hugs to calm us down. Richard got shot
    by a turret while we were exploring and the thing jumped in front of the turret
    fire! It tackled Richard and his wounds were no longer there. I wonder if we
    could bottle this stuff up and use it for healing injuries, it''d be a lot better
    than any modern medicine for sure.



    After having it around for a while
    we did learn that this little guy also likes healing other creatures, so we had
    to drag him away if we wanted to get rid of them.



    Many people might have
    many different name for this little guy, but the only good name i could give
    him was "friend" -Sigurd'
